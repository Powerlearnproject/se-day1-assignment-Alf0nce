Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software
It ensures reliability as it ensures that the software performs as expected
It ensure that the system security is implemented and practiced
Scalability and flexibility- Ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
It has mastered the processes hence ensuring no repeat of the same process many times.
It has mastered machines
It has also mustered complexicity

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Plannning- identify requirement and scope
Design- It building of the framework begins
Coding- Converting designs into code
Testing- examine the software for any bugs and code
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology is linear and sequential, each face is completed before moving on. testing is done at the end of the development process
Agile Methodology- iterative and incremental with multiple cycles and it has high flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. Testing is continuous and done after each iteration
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
-Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
-Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
Quality Assurance engineer
-Collarborate with software stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
-Confirm that the software meets the requirement before deploying it.
Project Manager
Assembles and leads the software development team
Discuss the projects and it's requirements with the client and the software developers.
Create a blueprint for the project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development Environment is a software platform that facilitates the creations of other applications by providing a space to write, compile and debug code e.g Visual Studio Code VSCode While;
Version Control systems are software tools that help software team manage changes to source code over time e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technology Advancement- Adopting continuous learning.
Time Constraints-Adope agile methodologies to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable springs
Software Security- research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
It is testing individual methods and functions of the classes components, or modules used and it ensures thta each unit performs its intended fuction correctly.
Intergrated test- Verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together and it helps ensure date flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing- Focus on the entire software system as whole and it helps verify that the systems meets all functions and non-fuctional requirements.
Acceptance tests- are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. Checks whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs
Importance
Increased Flexibility-can create prompts with domain- neutral instructions highlighting logital links and broad patterns
Development control- Gives delopers more control over user's interactions with the AI.
Improve user experience- Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear,
A red brand new car with is park between old white cars
specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
